## Authentication and Private Methods

In order to access private endpoints, set the `apiKey` and `apiSecret` collection variables.

See the `Pre-request Script` in the `Private` folder to see how requests are signed before being sent to the server. 

This can be adopted in your own project and migrated to any other programming language.
