# Independent Reserve .Net API Client

Independent Reserve C# API client and sample application.

The client wraps up all of the private and public methods exposed by the Independent Reserve API, and handles authentication when it is configured with a valid API Key and API Secret.
It is designed to be easily plugged in by 3rd party developers into their own applications.

The sample application shows how to use the client in a simple WPF application.
